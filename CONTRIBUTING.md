# Contributing to Members Enquiries

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Members Enquiries application! We welcome contributions from councils, developers, and the wider open source community.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open an Issue First

Before starting work on a contribution, please open an issue to discuss:
- **Bug reports** - Describe the issue and how to reproduce it
- **Feature requests** - Explain the use case and expected behaviour
- **Major changes** - Discuss architectural or breaking changes before coding

This helps us:
- Ensure alignment with project goals
- Avoid duplicate work
- Give feedback early
- Discuss implementation approach

### 2. Fork and Create a Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-fork]/members-enquiries.git
cd members-enquiries
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use clear branch names:
- `fix/bug-description` for bug fixes
- `feature/feature-name` for new features
- `docs/documentation-topic` for documentation updates

### 3. Make Your Changes

**Code Quality:**
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Run tests before submitting: `python -m pytest`

**Commit Messages:**
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Reference issue numbers: `Fixes #123`
- Keep commits logical and atomic

### 4. Submit a Pull Request

Include in your PR description:
- What problem does this solve?
- How does it solve the problem?
- Any testing you've done
- Screenshots (for UI changes)

We'll review your PR and may ask for changes or clarifications.
